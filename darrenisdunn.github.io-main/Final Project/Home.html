							<p>San Francisco International Airport, or SFO as it is more commonly called, is San Francisco's main international airport.</p>

							<p>In 2020, SFO served a total of 16,409,625 passengers with 79.9% of those being domestic flights and 20.1% of those being
							international flights</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>The largest airline, based on number of domestic and international passengers served at SFO, is United Airlines</p>
							<p>Fun fact: SFO is United Airlines' hub airport. This means that they use SFO as a main connection for all United Airlines
							flights coming in and out of central California. In addition, United Airlines has on of the largest maintenance hubs of any airline at SFO.</p>

								<h3>Personal Motivation</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I am an avid aviation geek! I love airplanes and I love flying. I would even park near the airport and just watch planes take off and land.
							Seeing how a large piece of aluminum just effortlessly takes off into the sky amazes me.
							If I were not a CS major, I would be working towards becoming a commercial pilot.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Growing up, I have traveled across the world with my parents. I would always be fascinated seeing all the different types of planes 
							sitting at the gates of San Francisco International Airport (SFO). 
							I slowly realized that there was a pattern of certain airlines being more popular than others.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Now that I am taking Data Visualization, 
							I want to take SFOâ€™s data on airlines that have visited the airport over the past several years and create visuals 
							to help people see which airlines have visited SFO the most and have served the most passengers.</p>

						<h3>Dataset</h3>
					</header>
					<p>I have used the SFO Air Traffic Passenger Statistics dataset provided by DataSF. To organize the data and conduct data processing and analysis,
					I have used Excel Version 2203. Using pivot tables and Excel functions, I have taken the data and created averages for every year from
					2019-2021.</p>

						<h3>Website Overview</h3>
					</header>
					<p>This website contains 4 different types of visualizations created from the data: Tree Maps, Circular Packing, Bar Charts, and Line Graphs.</p>
					<p>I invite you to click the SFO Map View button below to get started! Additionally, you may use the menu buttons to navigate the website.</p>
